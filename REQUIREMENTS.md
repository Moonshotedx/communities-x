üìù Requirements Document ‚Äì Community Forum Platform
Overview
This platform is a community-driven forum, akin to Reddit, where users from different organizations can post threads and engage in discussions. Built with Next.js 15, shadcn/ui, tRPC, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, and BetterAuth for authentication and organizational identity.

üöÄ Core Features

1. User Authentication and Organization Management
   Auth Library: BetterAuth

User-Org Relationship:

Users belong to Organizations (orgs).

Org membership is enforced via BetterAuth's org-based identity model.

Org Admin Capabilities:

Invite users via email or link.

View list of org members.

Manage roles (admin vs. regular user) within the org.

2. Threads (Posts)
   Users can:

Create a thread with a title and rich content (e.g., Markdown or rich text editor).

View all threads across the platform or filtered by their organization.

Edit or delete their own threads.

Threads include:

Author (user)

Org (derived from user)

Timestamp

Optional group (for future use)

3. Comments and Replies
   Each thread supports nested comments (infinite depth, though realistically a few levels deep).

Reply UX follows Reddit-style threading:

Replies are visually indented.

Collapse/expand thread replies.

Users can:

Comment on threads.

Reply to other comments.

Edit/delete their own comments.

4. Communities
   Communities are spaces where users can share and discuss content with specific groups of people.

Community Types:

Public Communities: Visible to all users.

Private Communities: Visible only to members and followers from allowed organizations.

Membership Models:

Follow:

- For Public Communities: Any user can follow.

- Followers can view content but cannot post within the community.

Join:

- For Private Communities: Users must request to join and be approved.
- Members can both view and post content within the community.

Community Management:

- Update community details (name, description, rules, etc.)
- Assign and remove moderator roles
- Approve/reject follow requests (for private communities)
